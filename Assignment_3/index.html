        <p>
            I have been lifting for three years now, and I have learned so much about it and the benefits of it. 
            There are thousands of benefits, and I have never felt better since. 
            I have used it for mental health to help get out of my head when I am stressed. 
            It can prevent major diseases such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and many others. 
            It can also help prevent injuries in other sports. 
            My favorite information I have learned is that the more muscle you have, the more fat you burn just by having it on you.

        <p style="color:red">
            Being a female, lifting is not heavily known. 
            Of all my friends, I am the only one who is very invested in lifting and reaping the benefits of it. 
            Most women think pilates is enough, but it is not because lifting makes your muscles stronger. 
            I notice at the gym that most people in the back of the gym with me are not female. 
            I hope for other females to understand that they can lift too and to not be afraid of it. 
            It will make them stronger.
