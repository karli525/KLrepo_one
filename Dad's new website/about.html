        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Langer has represented numerous individual and business clients in all phases of litigation, focusing on matrimonial and family law, commercial litigation, criminal defense and estate litigation. His representation, in addition to attempting to resolve disputes, involves every aspect of litigation, including pleadings, motions, discovery, depositions, subpoenas, hearings, trials and appeals. 
        <p>Mr. Langer began his legal career after graduating from the Hofstra University School of Law, with distinction, where he was a member of the Hofstra Law Review in which his Law Review Note was published. Even during law school, Mr. Langer represented indigent tenants in the Hofstra Law School clinic system, handling several trials and numerous other matters as a third-year law student under a student practice order. After graduation, Mr. Langer was appointed to the prestigious position as a Law Clerk in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Staff Attorney’s Office, where he interfaced with many judges, writing bench memoranda, analyzing pending appeals and appellate motions, and recommending dispositions. Upon completion of that clerkship, Mr. Langer was appointed as a Deputy County Attorney in the Nassau County Attorney’s Office, representing the County of Nassau, its agencies and employees in federal and state court on civil rights matters arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title VII, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and in various contractual matters and Article 78 proceedings. Before starting his own practice, Mr. Langer worked in a Nassau County law firm for many years in which he developed and shaped his career to its present level. Dozens of decisions in cases in which Mr. Langer represented clients, both at the trial-level and on appeal, and in numerous different courts, have been published and appear in many legal publications and online. Mr. Langer has prepared and persuasively argued dozens of appeals in addition to his usual responsibilities in representing clients, and he has been interviewed and quoted in the New York Law Journal with respect to various cases. Mr. Langer’s adversaries, in addition to his clients, often commend him on his strong advocacy and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to his legal practice, Mr. Langer is a contributing editor to the Nassau Lawyer, a Nassau County Bar Association monthly publication, and he has written a number of articles for publication, largely on the area of family law. He also serves as an arbitrator for the Attorney-Client Fee Dispute Resolution Program under Part 137 of the Rules of the Chief Administrator, and for many years, has served and continues to serve as an instructor at Hofstra University School of Law for the National Institute of Trial Advocacy (NITA) program, as well as other trial, appellate and skills programs.
