        <h1>What is The Cut?</h1>
        <p>Cutting is the phase focused on reducing body fat while preserving the muscle gained during the bulk. This is done by eating in a calorie deficit, meaning you consume fewer calories than your body uses. A successful cut involves carefully tracking food, maintaining a high protein intake, and often adding more cardio to the routine. The goal is to slowly shed fat without sacrificing strength or muscle definition. This phase is more physically and mentally demanding, but it is where the results of a long bulk are revealed. Cutting typically lasts a shorter period than bulking, depending on how much fat needs to be lost and how lean the individual wants to get.</p>

        <h1>What is the Bulk?</h1>
        <p>Bulking is the phase where the main goal is to build muscle by eating in a calorie surplus. This means consuming more calories than your body burns each day, giving it the energy and nutrients needed to grow. During a bulk, protein intake remains high to support muscle repair and growth, while carbohydrates and healthy fats provide fuel for intense workouts and recovery. While some fat gain is expected during this phase, the priority is maximizing muscle development over time. Bulking requires consistency, patience, and a long-term mindset, as it often lasts several months to allow noticeable progress.</p>

        <p>The time spent bulking is typically much longer than the time spent cutting. Bulking focuses on building muscle, and that process requires time, patience, and a consistent calorie surplus. Many lifters spend six to twelve months in a bulking phase, gradually increasing size and strength while accepting some fat gain along the way. This phase is essential for creating a solid foundation of muscle.</p>

        <p>Cutting, on the other hand, is a shorter and more intense phase. The goal is to reduce body fat while maintaining as much muscle as possible. For someone preparing for a bodybuilding or physique competition, cutting can last anywhere from eight to sixteen weeks. During this time, individuals follow a calorie deficit, increase cardio, and monitor their nutrition carefully to reveal muscle definition and stage-ready conditioning.</p>

        <p>In preparation for a show, the longer bulking phase builds the muscle needed to stand out, while the shorter cutting phase brings that muscle to the surface. Even for those not competing, this approach is a common and effective strategy for achieving a stronger and more defined physique.</p>

        <p>Cutting for competitions is about lowering body fat while keeping as much muscle as possible. It usually means eating in a calorie deficit and being really careful with food choices. People focus on high protein, lots of water, and getting enough sleep while also increasing cardio. Cutting is more strict than bulking because the goal is to get lean and stage-ready. It takes a lot of discipline but shows the results of all the work put in during the bulk.</p>

        <h2>The Bulk</h2>
        <p>Bulking for competitions means eating more to help build muscle and strength. During this time, people focus on getting enough protein, carbs, and healthy fats to support their training.</p>
        <p>It is not about eating junk food but more about planning meals that give your body what it needs. Most competitors bulk in the off-season so they can gain size before cutting down and getting lean for the actual show.</p>
