        <h1>What Are Supplements?</h1>
        <p>There are many different supplements people use to support their progress in the gym. Whether your goal is to build muscle, gain strength, improve endurance, or simply feel better during workouts, supplements can play a helpful role when used the right way. They are not magic solutions, but they can give you an extra push when paired with proper training, good nutrition, rest, and consistency.</p>

        <p>Some supplements are taken before a workout to help increase focus and energy, while others are taken afterward to support muscle recovery and growth. Some people use supplements daily, and others only take them on workout days. The important thing to know is that supplements are meant to support your progress, not replace the work or discipline required to reach your goals.</p>

        <p>Supplements can also help fill in nutritional gaps. For example, if someone struggles to get enough protein through food alone, a protein shake can help them meet their daily goal. If someone feels tired or unmotivated before training, pre-workout can help them push through and perform better. Other supplements support hydration, digestion, joint health, or recovery.</p>

        <p>Whether you’re just starting your fitness journey or looking to improve your performance in the gym, understanding how supplements work can help you make smarter, more confident choices for your body. With so many products on the market, it can be confusing at first. Not all supplements are necessary, and not every product will work the same for everyone. It is always a good idea to start with the basics and build from there if needed.</p>

        <p>In the sections below, you’ll find some of the most popular and trusted options used by people who lift — along with what they do and why they’re used.</p>

        <h2>Pre-workout and Protein Powder</h2>
        <p>Pre-workout and protein powder are two of the most popular gym supplements. Pre-workout is taken before training to help increase energy, focus, and endurance. Most pre-workouts contain caffeine and ingredients that improve blood flow and stamina. It is especially helpful on days when you feel tired but still want to get a good session in.</p>

        <p>Protein powder is usually taken after a workout to help your muscles recover and grow. It is a quick and easy way to get enough protein, especially if you're on the go or not getting enough from food alone. It comes in many forms, like whey, casein, or plant-based.</p>

        <h3>Creatine</h3>
        <p>Creatine is one of the most researched supplements in the fitness world. It helps increase strength, endurance, and performance by giving your muscles more energy during short, intense movements like lifting. Many people take creatine daily, and it can lead to noticeable strength gains over time. It is often tasteless and mixes easily with water or protein shakes. Creatine is safe when used correctly and works best when taken consistently.</p>

        <p>Green powders are a great option for people who want to get more fruits, vegetables, and micronutrients into their routine. If you struggle to eat enough greens every day, these powders provide an easy way to add vitamins, minerals, and digestive support to your diet. They are usually mixed with water or added to smoothies and help support gut health, immune function, and energy. Some include probiotics or added antioxidants for even more benefits.</p>
