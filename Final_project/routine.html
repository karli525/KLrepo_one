        <h2>🏁 Getting Started</h2>
        <p>When I first started lifting, I had no real idea what I was doing — just a desire to feel stronger, more confident, and more in control of my body. I was intimidated by the gym floor, so I stuck to the machines, repeating exercises I saw online or guessed would help. There was no split, no tracking, no form checks — just effort and trial and error. Full-body workouts became my default, even though I was often sore in the wrong places and saw little progress. Still, I kept showing up. I’d scroll through endless workout videos and routines, trying to find something that clicked. It took time, mistakes, and frustration before I began to build a rhythm that worked for me.</p>

        <h2>📆 Push-Pull-Legs Split</h2>
        <p>With time, I settled into a consistent weekly schedule. I trained five to six days a week, depending on how I felt — typically pushing on Mondays, pulling on Tuesdays, legs midweek, then repeating with different intensities. Thursdays or Sundays became flexible rest days. I learned the importance of listening to my body. Some weeks I had more energy and could push harder, while other times I scaled back to prevent burnout. I also started incorporating mobility work, active rest days, and more intentional warm-ups and cool-downs. My workouts weren’t just about lifting heavier anymore — they were about showing up for myself in a way that supported long-term growth.</p>

        <h2>🧘‍♀️ Where I Am Now</h2>
        <p>Right now I lift heavy about 4 to 5 times a week. I used to go 6 days straight but it started to feel like too much and I realized I wasn’t giving my body enough time to recover. I’ve learned that rest actually helps me get stronger. My workouts now feel more focused. I still do mostly strength training but I’ve started adding a little cardio here and there and I want to do more of it over time. My lifts are more intentional now and I’ve stopped feeling like I need to do everything all at once. I’m working on getting stronger but also building my endurance and just feeling good overall.</p>
