        <h2>üç© Where I Began</h2>
        <p>When I started lifting, I had no idea how important nutrition really was. I snacked without intention, mostly sugar, processed food, and barely any protein. I thought training alone would be enough. I was not correct. I used to eat burgers and meat most days without thinking about what my body actually needed. Within the last year I completely changed my diet. I focus a lot more on plant protein now and I feel so much better. For the past six months, I‚Äôve been eating things like chickpeas, edamame, lentils, tofu, and protein pasta. My energy has changed, my digestion has improved, and I feel way more in control of how I fuel myself.</p>

        <h2>ü•£ Learning to Meal Prep Bulking Meals</h2>
        <p>Eventually, I learned to prep. Chicken, rice, oats, and eggs became my go-to ingredients. I started tracking macros, using measuring cups, and cooking on Sundays. It became less of a chore and more of a commitment to myself. At first it felt overwhelming, but once I figured out what worked for me, it got easier. I realized that prepping helped me stay consistent during the week, especially when I was busy. I didn‚Äôt have to guess what to eat or reach for junk. I also started experimenting with high-protein recipes and better plant-based options. Now I actually enjoy it. Meal prep gives me structure and helps me feel in control.</p>

        <h2>ü•ó Where I Am Now</h2>
        <p>Today my meals are high-protein, clean, and consistent. I fuel with carbs before workouts and recover with whole foods after. I‚Äôve learned to see food as fuel ‚Äî not punishment or reward ‚Äî and that mindset changed everything.</p>
