        <h2>🌧️ Confidence & Setbacks</h2>
        <p>This wasn’t just about lifting. It became about trust. I had to trust my body, trust my discipline, and trust myself to keep going. I used to quit things when they got hard or when I didn’t feel good enough. But this time, I stayed. I kept showing up even when I didn’t feel confident. That changed something in me. I started to believe I could actually follow through. I wasn’t just going to the gym — I was proving to myself that I’m capable. That feeling of doing what I said I would do gave me confidence nothing else ever has. It made me proud in a way that stuck.</p>
